    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "originated by `Allen Downey`\n",
    "\n",
    "*Elements of Data Science* is an introduction to data science in Python for people with no programming experience.  My goal is to present a small, powerful subset of Python that allows you to do real work in data science as quickly as possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, I want to make sure the material is presented clearly.  I don't assume that the reader knows anything about programming, statistics, or data science.  When I use a term, I try to define it immediately, and when I use a programming feature, I try to explain it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few places where I use a programming feature before it is fully explained, but I keep them to a minimum, and I'll let you know what you don't need to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"book\" is in the form of Jupyter notebooks.  Jupyter is a software development tool you can run in a web browser, so you don't have to install any software.  A Jupyter notebook is a document that contains text, Python code, and results.  So you can read it like a book, but you can also modify the code, run it, develop new programs, and test them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks contains exercises where you can practice what you learn.  Most of the exercises are meant to be quick, but a few are more substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "This material is a work in progress, so suggestions are welcome.  The best way to provide feedback is to [click here and create an issue in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ElementsOfDataScience/issues)."

    "For each of the notebooks below, you have 3 options: if you view the notebook on `Github`, you can read it, but you can't run the code.  If you run the notebook on `Colab`, you'll be able to run the code, do the exercises, and save your modified version of the notebook in a Google Drive (if you have one). At last, you can run it on your `local host` machine, if you can sucessfully install the Jupyter environment.\n",
